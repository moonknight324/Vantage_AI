# 🧠 Vantage AI – PersonaPilot

**"Let AI think like your persona to give you structured, relevant, actionable insights."**

Vantage AI is an advanced, persona-driven decision assistant powered by Generative AI. It helps users make better decisions by adapting its answers to different *personas* – like a college student, budget traveler, developer, startup founder, sci-fi writer, and more.

## 💡 What It Does

Vantage AI enables users to:

- 🔧 **Define or select a persona**
- 💬 **Ask contextual, open-ended queries** (e.g., *“Plan a 5-day trip for me under ₹15K”*)
- 📦 **Receive structured, highly relevant output**, tailored to their persona's mindset

Behind the scenes, Vantage AI uses:

- 🧩 **Prompt engineering** for accurate persona alignment  
- 📚 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to fetch insights from documents, APIs, and knowledge bases  
- 🛠️ **Function calling** to perform actions like:
  - Summarizing relevant documents  
  - Ranking recommendations  
  - Generating to-do lists or visual timelines  

## 🚀 Example Use Cases

| Persona | Prompt | Output |
|--------|--------|--------|
| College Student | *"Plan a side hustle I can start with no money"* | Ranked list of ideas + 30-day roadmap |
| Budget Traveler | *"Make a 5-day itinerary for Goa under ₹10K"* | Daily travel + stay plan + booking links |
| Startup Founder | *"Analyze latest AI trend for MVP potential"* | SWOT + Market fit + Build tools |
| Sci-Fi Writer | *"Help me write a plot based on AI and rebellion"* | Scene-wise outline + Character arcs |
